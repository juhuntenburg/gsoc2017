<p>Reaching out to the neuroimaging community regarding means of software distribution got me many helpful replies and I learned quite a bit about Docker and related tools along the way. My main take-aways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Docker as a scientific tool in the neuroimaging community is of growing importance, as exemplified by <a href="http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/">BIDS Apps</a> or <a href="http://natacha-beck.github.io/cbrain_docker/#/">CBRAIN</a>. However, it still in an early stage so that widespread adoption will take time and installation procedures might need to be tweaked due to changes to the Docker project itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Default Docker images such as AlpineLinux do not add a lot of overhead (they are much smaller than virtual machines) and should not result in a significant performance penalties unless one is dealing with super efficient numerical code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Docker in combination with <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov/">Singularity</a> helps to run containers without root access and without Docker being actually installed, e.g. on HPCs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When distributing through Docker it is even more important to have good regression tests across platforms and software versions. There are two projects trying to make this easier: <a href="https://github.com/kaczmarj/neurodocker">neurodocker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/niceman">niceman</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One interesting approach is, in addition to the Docker image, to publish a <a href="https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/blob/master/wrapper/fmriprep_docker.py">standalone script</a> that generates Docker commands for users through <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fmriprep-docker">PyPI</a>, so it can be install with pip.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most helpful comments regarding our project I found to be this (<a href="https://neurostars.org/t/using-docker-to-distribute-highres-neuroimaging-software/442/2?u=juhuntenburg">on neurostars.org</a>):</p>

<p>"If you are looking to distribute a library that is intended to be integrated with other software wrapping it in Docker will make it hard if not impossible. If you are looking to distribute a command line tool with complex set of dependencies Docker is a good fit."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the replies and talking to my mentors I got the sense that it will be the best choice for us to focus on more traditional ways of download and installation for now. Especially, because integrating our tools with other software is a main objective of this project. But we will also explore if it makes sense to additionally provide a Docker Image later on.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for all the helpful comments and suggestions!</em></p>

<p>This week, GSoC started with the "community bonding" phase. I already feel pretty bonded with my software community (in fact I constitute 1/3 of it), so I use the time to reach out to the larger neuroimaging community regarding one of the first issues I want to address:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What is the best way to distribute the Python version of CBS Tools?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have previously discussed this question with my mentors and other colleagues, and one suggestion that came up is to deploy the tools via <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. In order to find out what neuroimaging folks think about docker I have started discussion threads on <a href="https://neurostars.org/t/using-docker-to-distribute-highres-neuroimaging-software/442">neurostars</a> and in the <a href="https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/">brainhack slack team</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know very little about docker myself, so I also started watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAAzevEST2qm2Xbe3aeLFvLc">tutorials</a>. Whether we end up using it or not, my feeling is it won&#8217;t hurt in the future to know a thing or two about docker.</p>
