= Like a real blog

Today I moved my blog from pure github pages to LINK[hubpress] (which is built on github pages). Takes a few hours of figuring out the setup and switching from Markdown to LINK[AsciiDoc].* But from there writing and publishing new posts is simple, and it just looks a bit more like a real blog (maybe I even figure out the cover image eventually). It's cool how many different things I get to learn through GSoC, for which I probably wouldn't take time otherwise during my PhD.

_* I found LINK[atom]'s AsciiDoc preview and syntax highlighting extensions to help a lot with that_
