This week was special, the official birth of *_Nighres -- Processing tools for high-resolution neuroimaging_*.

Nighres is the name that we decided on for our package. __Ni__ for consistency with other neuroimaging tools in the LINK[Nipy] (Neuroimaging in Python) community. And __nighres__ in analogy to __highres__ (as in high-resolution data), and because it's easy to remember and type, and not yet taken on github.

Just born and baptized, nighres soon started making its first step into the software world. It got its own LINK[github organization], including a LINK[website], and inherited the LINK[repo] I had been working on so far during GSoC. Conveniently, github makes it super easy to LINK[transfer a repo] with all history and even issues and project boards.

Excited to help _nighres_ grow into a real software package during the next weeks, so that it soon start to make friends in the Nipy community!
